/// methods like `unwrap()`. This function provides no actual safety guarantees;
/// it only serves as a marker for linter rules and to signal to developers
/// that the contained code can throw exceptions from monad operations.
///
/// Use this to explicitly acknowledge that you are handling a potentially
/// failing operation outside the monadic context.
