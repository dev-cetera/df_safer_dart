# TODO

- [ ] Rename the linter rules to something more explicit and precise.
- [ ] When using `await Future.wait([Future.value(1)])` in an Async for example, the linter shows a warning when it shouldn't. It thinks `Future.value(1)` isn't beiing awaited.
- [ ] Improve package by studying `fpdart` and `ribs_core` by using it in a project and parsing it through AI.
